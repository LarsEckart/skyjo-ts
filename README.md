# skyjo-ts

## The Plan

We want to collaboratively work together and develop another frontend for Lars' skyjo backend. We will use TypeScript and React to build the frontend. We will use the following tools:

- [Git Handover](https://mob.sh/) (please install this tool before our session)
- [Mob Timer](https://mobti.me)

## Resources

There is already a frontend for the skyjo backend. You can find it [here](https://www.skyjo.tomiste.com/). It's written in Angular and can be our inspiration. Easiest is probably if we really just try to build a clone of this frontend.
OpenAPI documentation for the backend can be found [here](https://play-skyjo-ae5db0018a23.herokuapp.com/swagger-ui/index.html).
